# Fresh Start Grooming Lounge — website

A luxury, dark-and-gold, fully interactive website for **Fresh Start Grooming Lounge**
(logo: *Fresh Start BARBERS*), Superior Center, Kenyatta Avenue, 4th Floor, Suite K-5, Nairobi.

> *Every haircut is a fresh start.*

**Layout cloned from [hicksonsolarsolution.vercel.app](https://hicksonsolarsolution.vercel.app/)** —
same section-by-section structure and flow, but dressed entirely in the Fresh Start
**barber theme** (near-black & gold, Cormorant Italic accents, barber-pole stripes) with all
barber content, plus livelier header/footer and a full **Google Reviews** section.

Built as a hand-crafted static site (Vite + vanilla JS, no framework runtime) with self-hosted
variable fonts, local photography and a WhatsApp reservation flow.

| --- | --- |
| Hero “Power, Wire & Connect…” + 3 CTAs + trust chips + stats bar | **“Cut. Shave. Refresh. *Every Haircut Is A Fresh Start.*”** — brand manifesto lede (reset & reclaim your confidence), “This is more than a haircut…” creed, *#Where Real Men Like You Belong*, Reserve / Call / WhatsApp CTAs, trust chips, animated stats (25 rituals · 5 barbers · 5.0★ · from KSh 500) and a floating Google-rating badge; the marquee leads with **Confidence · Identity · Dignity · Self-Respect** |

### Lively header
- Animated **barber-pole stripe** (gold/black/cream) across the very top and the footer.
- **Top announcement bar**: live **Open now / Closed / By appointment** badge (Africa/Nairobi
  clock), a **rotating offers ticker** (referral Classic Shave, 3-person package, Mbogi Experience, Sunday premium policy…),
  phone, address and socials.
- Sticky glass header that **shrinks + shadows on scroll**, brand logo with ★★★★★ 5.0 mini-rating,
  **sliding gold nav pill** with scroll-spy active states, theme toggle, call button, gold Reserve
  button and an animated mobile menu. Gold scroll-progress hairline up top.

### Google Reviews (new)
- Authentic white Google summary card: multicolour **Google** wordmark, verified chip, big **5.0**,
  stars, animated **rating breakdown bars**, *Review Us On Google* / *Read All On Google* buttons
  (point at the lounge's Google Maps listing).
- **Auto-rotating carousel**: 3 reviews at a time (2 on tablet, 1 on phone), refreshes every
  4 seconds with a gold progress bar, dots, prev/next, `1–3 of 9` counter. **Hover or tap a card
  to pause** — exactly like the reference layout.
- Review cards carry coloured initial avatars, Google “G”, 5 stars + verified tick, service tag
  and time. Edit or swap in live Google reviews any time in `REVIEWS` / `REVIEW_SUMMARY`
  inside **`src/data.js`**.

### Lively footer
- Barber-pole top edge, “Ready for a *fresh start?*” CTA row with live open-status, 4 columns
  (brand + Google 5.0 card + socials with handles, Explore, Popular Rituals that **one-tap book**,
  Visit Us with directions + animated back-to-top), a giant outlined **FRESH START** watermark,
  and a legal bar with the 5.0 Google line.

### Mobile optimisation
Verified in a headless browser at **280 / 320 / 360 / 375 / 390 / 412 / 430 / 768 / 1024px**:
document width equals viewport width at every size — **zero horizontal page scrolling** and no
clipped text. Grid/flex children carry `min-width: 0` (so the booking date-strip scrolls inside
its own box instead of stretching the page), `fr` tracks are `minmax(0, 1fr)`, buttons/labels
wrap instead of forcing width, headings use fluid `clamp()` sizes with balanced wrapping, form
controls are 16px (no iOS focus-zoom), slots become a tidy 3-up grid, and the footer watermark
scales to fit. Internal rails (barbers, date strip) still swipe sideways by design — the page
itself never does.

### Final refinements
- Hero statistics carry their final values in markup (**25, 5, 5.0★, KSh 500 services from**) and
  the count-up glides from 55% of target, so a counter can never display 0 / “KSh 0”.
  No years-of-experience statistics are shown.
- Services are arranged **lowest → highest price within each category** (menu order and booking
  dropdown).
- Reviews reflect a diverse five-star clientele — Nairobi regulars, Somali gentlemen and
  international guests (London, Dubai, Berlin).
- Opening hours are consistent everywhere: **walk-ins welcome Mon–Sat** (Thu from 8:30 am);
  Sunday is listed verbatim as **“By Appointment Only! Premium Rates Apply.”** in the hours
  table, hero, footer, FAQs, date strip (today-Sunday disabled), booking summary and WhatsApp
  handoff — with the premium rate confirmed before a Sunday chair is reserved.
- Offers: **The Mbogi Experience** (3 student haircuts, KSh 2,500, **Mon–Wed only**, student ID
  optional — enforced in booking validation); **3-Person Haircut Package** (KSh 3,000, 90 min);
  **Bring 2 Friends referral** (two Bespoke Haircuts at KSh 1,500 each; the host's Classic Shave
  is complimentary in the same 90-minute visit).

### Kept from the previous barber site
Loading screen (logo, igniting stars, “5 Star Rated”), dark/light themes stored in
`localStorage`, all **25 services**, all **5 barbers**, complimentary refreshments, socials,
past-slot blocking (45-min buffer), `/` search shortcut, toasts, lightbox, sticky selection
bar, JSON-LD `HairSalon`, `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
